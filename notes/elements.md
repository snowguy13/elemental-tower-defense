Elements
===============

There are four elements:
- Water
- Air
- Fire
- Lightning

The elements form an advantage circle as follows:
Lightning -> Fire -> Wind -> Water -> Lightning
...where A -> B means A is strong when attacking B.

The advantages are organized such that elements that "control" others are strong
against those elements:
- *Lightning* creates *fire* when it strikes
- Large *fires* create strong *winds*
- *Wind* is responsible for carrying *water* around the planet
- Large amounts of *water* form storms which cause *lightning*

Elemental Compositions
----------------------

All entities take on an elemental composition, which describes which elements
make up the entity. In doing so, the composition also determines what the
entity's strengths and weaknesses are.

Elemental Ether
---------------

Elemental Ethers are substances that permeate the map
