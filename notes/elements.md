Elements
===============

There are four elements:
- Water
- Air
- Fire
- Lightning

The elements form an advantage circle as follows:
Lightning -> Fire -> Wind -> Water -> Lightning
...where A -> B means A is strong when attacking B.

The advantages are organized such that elements that "control" others are strong
against those elements:
- *Lightning* creates *fire* when it strikes
- Large *fires* create strong *winds*
- *Wind* is responsible for carrying *water* around the planet
- Large amounts of *water* form storms which cause *lightning*

Elemental Compositions
----------------------

All entities take on an elemental composition, which describes which Elements
make up the entity. In doing so, the composition also determines what the
entity's strengths and weaknesses are.

Elemental Energy
----------------

Elemental Energies are used to initiate the construction of new Towers or the
upgrading of existing Towers. They are also used to repair Towers that have been
damaged.

Energies are gained by defeating enemies. Additionally, there is a base Energy
generation rate for each Element that can be upgraded throughout the campaign.

Elemental Ether
---------------

Elemental Ethers are substances that permeate the map. They are necessary to
perform the construction and repair of Towers. In addition, Ethers are the form
of energy used by Towers to fire Bullets.

All Towers possess an innate ability to gather Ethers from the environment;
however, in general they do so very poorly. As such, there are specialized
Towers designed specifically for the purpose of gathering Ether. These Towers
do not attack Enemies; instead, they transfer their gathered Ether to Towers
within their range.
